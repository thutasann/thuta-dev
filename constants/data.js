      `I've been developing websites since I was 18 years old. I started my web development career with HTML, CSS and PHP. and After PHP, I've learnt Laravel web Framework.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using Bootstrap and Tailwind so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew Tailwind, you were cool. ðŸ‘½`,

Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
